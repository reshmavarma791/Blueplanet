<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When done correctly, tree planting is recognised as one of the most enjoyable and environmentally friendly activities that people can engage in to benefit the earth. Trees offer several long- and short-term advantages. They not only look good, but they help minimise the risk of floods, enhance air quality, and lessen the urban heat island effect by reflecting sunlight and giving shade.</p>

<p>A tree plantation, also known as a forest plantation, a plantation forest, or a timber plantation, is a forest established for volumes of wood production, usually as a monoculture forest.</p>

<h3><strong>TREE PLANTATION EXPLAINED:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>State forestry agencies, the paper and timber companies, and other private landowners all grow plantations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christmas trees are frequently cultivated on plantations, and teak plantations have recently supplanted native forests in southern and southeast Asia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the commercial production of forest products, industrial plantations are actively managed. Large-scale industrial plantations are common.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individual blocks are usually uniform in age and contain only one or two species. These species might be either foreign or native.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The plants employed in the plantation are frequently genetically modified for desired features like growth and resistance to pests and diseases in general, as well as specialised traits, such as volumic wood production and stem straightness in the case of timber species.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Genetic change begins with forest genetic resources. Seeds from selected individuals produced in seed orchards can be used to develop adequate planting material.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because their leaf oils and resins are combustible to the point of being explosive under certain conditions, some plantation trees, such as pines and eucalyptus, are at high risk of fire damage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In rare circumstances, however, a pest-infested plantation can be cleaned of pest species for a low cost using a managed burn that does not affect the mature trees.</p>
