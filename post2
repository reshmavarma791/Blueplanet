Hence, trees are worshiped in India and cutting if trees are considered ill. But today, due to industrialization and urbanization, trees are rapidly cut. We believe it as our growth in society, but the reality is something opposite to what we assume. Today, cities are becoming a concrete jungle surrounded by sky-touching architectures and factories. Due to deforestation, the probability of land degradation, and drastic climatic changes, some animal species have come to an end.</p>
