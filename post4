<p>This article describes the plantation system in America as an instrument of British colonialism characterized by social and political inequality. It links the agricultural prosperity of the South with the domination by wealthy aristocrats and the exploitation of slave labor.</p>

<p>The term&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;arose as&nbsp;settlements&nbsp;in the southern United States, originally linked with colonial expansion, came to revolve around the production of&nbsp;agriculture. The word&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;first appeared in English in the 15th century. Originally, the word meant to plant. However, what came to be known as&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;became the center of large-scale enslaved&nbsp;labor&nbsp;operations in the Western Hemisphere. Historians Peter H. Wood and Edward Baptist advocate to stop using the word&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;when referencing agricultural operations involving forced&nbsp;labor. Instead they suggest calling these places “labor&nbsp;camps” or “slave&nbsp;labor&nbsp;camps.”</p>

<p>The&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;system developed in the American South as British colonists arrived in what became known as Virginia and divided the land into large areas suitable for farming. The land on which these&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;were established was stolen through canceled, disregarded, and deceitful treaties, or outright violence from indigenous nations.

<p>The&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;system came to dominate the culture of the South, and it was rife with inequity from the time it was established. In 1606, King James I formed the Virginia Company of London to establish colonies in North America, but when the British arrived, they faced a harsh and foreboding&nbsp;wilderness, and their lives became little more than a struggle for survival. So, to make settling the land more attractive, the Virginia Company offered any adult man with the means to travel to America 50&nbsp;acres&nbsp;of land. At the encouragement of the Company, many of the settlers banded together and created large&nbsp;settlements, called hundreds, as they were intended to support 100 individuals, usually men who led a household.</p>

<p>The hundreds were run as private&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;intent on making a profit from the cultivation of&nbsp;crops, which the economy of the South depended on. The climate of the South was ideally suited to the cultivation of&nbsp;cash crops. Unlike small, subsistence farms,&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;were created to grow&nbsp;cash&nbsp;crops&nbsp;for sale on the market. The&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;system was an early&nbsp;capitalist&nbsp;venture. England’s King James had every intention of profiting from&nbsp;plantations.&nbsp;Tobacco&nbsp;and&nbsp;cotton&nbsp;proved to be exceptionally&nbsp;profitable.</p>

<p>Therefore, cheap&nbsp;labor&nbsp;was used. Initially,&nbsp;indentured servants, who were mostly from England (and sometimes from Africa), and enslaved African and (less often) Indigenous people to work the land.&nbsp;Indentured servants&nbsp;were contracted to work four- to seven-year terms without pay for passage to the colony, room, and board. After completing the term, they were often given land, clothes, and provisions.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;system created a society sharply divided along&nbsp;class&nbsp;lines. The wealthy aristocrats who owned&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;established their own rules and practices. For this reason, the contrast between the rich and the poor was greater in the South than it was in the North. Though wealthy aristocrats ruled the&nbsp;plantations, the&nbsp;laborers&nbsp;powered the system. In the colonies south of Pennsylvania and east of the Delaware River, a few wealthy, white landowners owned the bulk of the land, while the majority of the population was made up of poor farmers,&nbsp;indentured servants, and the enslaved. Enslaved Africans were first brought to Virginia in 1619.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;settlements&nbsp;required a large number of&nbsp;laborers&nbsp;to sustain them. Because these&nbsp;crops&nbsp;required large areas of land, the&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;grew in size, and in turn, more&nbsp;labor&nbsp;was required to work on the&nbsp;plantations.&nbsp;Plantation&nbsp;labor&nbsp;shifted away from indentured servitude and more toward&nbsp;slavery&nbsp;by the late 1600s. Obtaining&nbsp;indentured servants&nbsp;became more difficult as more economic opportunities became available to them. Wealthy landowners also made purchasing land more difficult for former&nbsp;indentured servants. This sharpened&nbsp;class&nbsp;divisions, as a small number of people owned larger and larger&nbsp;plantations. Wealthy landowners got wealthier, and the use of slave&nbsp;labor&nbsp;increased. This led to uprisings and skirmishes with impoverished Black and white people joining forces against the wealthy.</p>

<p>In response, customs changed and laws were passed to elevate the status of poor white people above all Black people. This new&nbsp;class&nbsp;acted as a buffer to protect the wealthy and Black people in the British American colonies were further&nbsp;oppressed. People of African descent were forced into a permanent underclass.</p>

<p>Despite this brutal history,&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;are not always seen as the violent places they were. For some, the word&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;suggests an idyllic past. This is seen at some of the United States&nbsp;plantations&nbsp;themselves with tours and tourists focusing on the wealth and lives of the enslavers, while ignoring those they enslaved.</p>

<p>These romanticized notions largely stem from an&nbsp;ideology&nbsp;called the Lost Cause which became popular shortly after the United States Civil War. The Confederates seceded from the United States to maintain the system of&nbsp;slavery. After losing the war, many Confederates and Confederate sympathizers altered the reason for succession. This switch became known as the Lost Cause. The&nbsp;ideology&nbsp;was named after an 1866 book by Edward A. Pollard, a newspaper editor from Virginia who supported the Confederacy.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lost Cause&nbsp;ideology&nbsp;puts the Confederates in a favorable light, according to Caroline Janney, professor of History of the American Civil War at the University of Virginia. She says the Lost Cause claims: 1) Confederates were patriots fighting to protect their constitutionally granted states’ rights; 2) Confederates were not fighting to protect&nbsp;slavery; 3)&nbsp;Slavery&nbsp;was a benevolent institution in which Black people were treated well; 4) Enslaved Black people were faithful to their enslavers and happy to be held in bondage; and 5) Confederate General Robert E. Lee and, to a lesser extent, General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson were godlike figures. None of these claims are true. The Lost Cause perpetuates harmful and false narratives.</p>

<p>Besides Pollard’s book, other works have carried the Lost Cause lie, including the 1864 painting, the “Burial of Latané” by William Washington, Thomas Dixon Jr.’s 1905 novel and play,&nbsp;<em>The Clansman</em>, and Margaret Mitchell’s 1936 novel&nbsp;<em>Gone with the Wind</em>. The last two became popular movies;&nbsp;<em>The Clansman</em>&nbsp;became&nbsp;<em>The Birth of a Nation</em>. Lost Cause propaganda was also continued by former Confederate General Jubal Early as well as various organizations of upper- and middle-class&nbsp;white Southern women — the Ladies Memorial Associations, the United Confederate Veterans, and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Douglas V. Armstrong is an&nbsp;anthropologist&nbsp;from New York whose studies on&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;slavery&nbsp;have been focused on the Caribbean. In the Caribbean, as well as in the slave states, the shift from small-scale farming to industrial&nbsp;agriculture&nbsp;transformed the culture of these societies, as their economic prosperity depended on the&nbsp;plantation. Until the&nbsp;transatlantic&nbsp;slave trade was&nbsp;abolished&nbsp;in 1807, over 12 million Africans were transported to the ‘New World,’ and over 90 percent of them went to the Caribbean and South America, to work on sugar&nbsp;plantations. Throughout the Western Hemisphere, the&nbsp;plantation&nbsp;served as an institution in itself, characterized by social and political&nbsp;inequality, racial conflict, and domination by the planter&nbsp;class.</p>

<p>Plantation&nbsp;slavery&nbsp;was not exclusive to the Americas. They were also found in Africa and Asia were also based on&nbsp;slavery. However, that discussion is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
